This readme file illustrates the purpose of this branch. Alex branch 
was meant to demonstrate the ability to form a branch in github. 

From the OpenCV sample code base Xiang and I used watershed.py and 
played with inputs to the program. watershed.py allows the user to 
input an image then color the image to using 7 different colors. 

The images that were used have been added to the Alex Branch.
